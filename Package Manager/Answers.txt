1. Installing is basically the same, you do 'yum install package' or 'apt-get install package' you get the same result.Yum automatically refreshes the list of packages, whilst with apt-get you must execute a command 'apt-get update' to get the fresh packages.Another difference is upgrading all the packages. With yum you did 'yum upgrade' and with apt-get you get a new option' apt-get dist-upgrade' which will hopefully upgrade your whole distribution.

2. A file with the DEB file extension is a Debian Software Package file. They're used mainly in Unix-based operating systems, including Ubuntu and iOS.

Every DEB file consists of two TAR archives that make up the executable files, documentation, and libraries. It may or may not be compressed using GZIP, BZIP2, LZMA, or XZ.

3. You can install it using sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file followed by sudo apt-get install -f.

4. A file with the RPM file extension is a Red Hat Package Manager file that's used to store installation packages on Linux operating systems.

RPM files provide an easy way for software to be distributed, installed, upgraded, and removed since the files are "packaged" in one place.

Completely unrelated to what Linux uses them for, RPM files are also used as RealPlayer Plug-in files by the RealPlayer software to add additional features to the program.
